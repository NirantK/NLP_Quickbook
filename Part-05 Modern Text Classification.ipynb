   "source": [
    "Text Classification is a very frequently seen challenge. This has several applications ranging from sentiment analysis, tagging and filtering news articles, and detecting fraud reviews (on websites such as Amazon) to name a few. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will be working with a sentiment analysis dataset. For same reasons, we evaluate accuracy as our only metric here. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have a curated set of movie reviews picked up from Imdb. Each review is marked as either positive or negative. Ofcourse, this marks the overall sentiment of each review. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning this section, we will incorporate more and more Machine Learning instead of relying on linguistics analysis alone. In writing this, I assume that you have some basic familiarity with Python packages like [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't, that's fine too. The intent here is too give you a quick reference of how these APIs functions work and save your time in looking up what to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can and must learn to use such functions well, even without knowing all the nitty gritty of underlying math. You can trust these functions as black boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by simply tries a few machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees. \n",
    "Next, we try Random Forest and Extra Trees Classifier. For all of these implementations, we don't use anything except scikit-learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizing Simple Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "We can tweak the simple classifiers above to improve their performance. For this, the most common method is to try several slightly different versions of the classifier. We do this by changing the parameters of our classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn how to automate this \"search\" process for the best classifier parameters using *GridSearch* and *RandomizedSearch*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble several different classifiers means we will be using a group of models. It is a very popular and easy to understand machine learning technique. This is part of almost every winning Kaggle competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite initial concerns of why this might be slow, some teams working on commercial software have begun using this in production software as well. This is because it requires very little overhead, is easy to parallelize, and allows for a built-in fallback of using a single model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at some of the simplest ensembling techniques based on simple majority, also known as voting ensemble and build using that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this **Machine Learning for NLP** section covers simple classifiers, parameter optimization, and ensemble methods"
